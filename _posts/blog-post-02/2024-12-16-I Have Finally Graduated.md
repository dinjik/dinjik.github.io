## I Graduated from Seneca College! ðŸŽ“  

After two years of hard work, long nights, and plenty of caffeine, Iâ€™ve officially graduated from **Seneca College** with a diploma in **Computer Systems Technician**! Itâ€™s been a journey full of challenges, hands-on projects, and personal growth, so I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my time in the program and whatâ€™s next for me.

## **The Journey Through the Program**  

Enrolling in the **Computer Systems Technician** program was one of the better decisions Iâ€™ve made in the recent years. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve gained a strong foundation in networking, system administration, security, and troubleshooting, which has prepared me for the IT industry.  

Some of the highlights of the program:  

- **Networking & Cybersecurity** â€“ Learning about network design, configuring routers and switches, and understanding security fundamentals doing hands-on projects/labs was one of my favorite parts.  
- **Hands-on Labs & Projects** â€“ The program was tough, and there were plenty of labs and hands-on projects that required critical thinking and troubleshooting. While challenging, they helped me build real-world skills that I know will be valuable in the field.  
- **Late-Night Sessions** â€“ Letâ€™s be real, nothing builds character like spending hours trying to fix a problem or configure something only to realize you missed the obvious.

It wasnâ€™t always smooth sailingâ€”there were difficult exams, complex scenarios, and plenty of technical headachesâ€”but all of those experiences helped me grow and become more confident in my technical skills.

## **Whatâ€™s Next?**  

I strongly believe that graduating from Seneca was just the beginning. My next step is to continue my education by pursuing Senecaâ€™s **Honours Bachelor of Information Technology â€“ Cybersecurity** degree. This program will allow me to dive deeper into cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and advanced networking, expanding my technical expertise even further.  

At the same time, Iâ€™m working on obtaining more industry certifications to enhance my knowledge and career prospects. My focus currently is on **Network+** and **Security+**. Eventually, I will try to obtain other cybersecurity-related certs that will help me break into the industry.  

On top of all of that, Iâ€™ll also be **looking for a job in the IT or cybersecurity field** while continuing my studies. Gaining real-world experience alongside my education will be key to applying what Iâ€™ve learned and growing as a professional.

## **Final Thoughts**  

Of course this was an exciting milestone, but I know thereâ€™s still a long road ahead. One thing Iâ€™ve learned is that technology never stops evolving, and neither should I.  

If youâ€™re on a similar journeyâ€”whether youâ€™re studying, working toward certifications, or making your way into ITâ€”just keep pushing forward. Every challenge is a learning experience, and every step gets you closer to your goals.
