## How I Passed My Network+ Certification Exam  

After 4 weeks of preparation, I passed the **CompTIA Network+ exam** with a score of **830**. The journey was definitely a challenge, but I found a study approach that worked well for me. In this post, I‚Äôll share my study plan, resources, and how the actual exam played out‚Äîincluding my strategy for handling the PBQs (spoiler: I skipped them at first).  

## Why I Took the Network+ Exam  

Since I have a **diploma in Computer Systems Technician**, I wanted to reinforce my networking fundamentals with an industry-recognized certification. Network+ is a great entry-level cert that covers essential networking topics and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced ones like **Security+ or CCNA**. Plus, it‚Äôs a solid credential for my resume while job hunting in IT and cybersecurity.

## How I Studied  

I set aside **4 weeks** for preparation, making sure to balance reading, videos, and practice tests. Here‚Äôs exactly what I did:  

### 1. Understanding the Exam Objectives  
Before anything, I downloaded the **official CompTIA Network+ objectives** and used them to track my progress. This helped me focus only on relevant topics.  

### 2. Study Resources I Used  

üìñ **Courses & Books:**  
- **Network+ Crash Course by Kevin Wallace** ‚Äì My main study guide, which gave me a structured approach to the exam.  
- **Professor Messer‚Äôs Network+ Course (Speed-Watched on the Last Couple Days)** ‚Äì By that point, I already knew the material well, so I watched it at 2x speed to validate my knowledge and reinforce key points.  

üìù **Practice Tests:**  
- **Craig Zecker‚Äôs Practice Tests** ‚Äì These were a huge help in familiarizing myself with the question format and improving my time management.  
- **Other Free Practice Exams** ‚Äì I took a mix of free online tests to get exposure to different question styles.  

üñ• **Hands-On Labs & Tools:**  
- **Wireshark & Packet Tracer** ‚Äì Helped reinforce networking concepts and troubleshooting skills.

## Exam-Day Strategy & Experience  

The **exam had 80 questions**, including **6 PBQs (performance-based questions)** at the beginning. I knew PBQs could be time-consuming, so I **skipped all of them at first** and went straight to the multiple-choice questions. By the time I finished those, I had about **50 minutes left** to tackle the PBQs.  

Out of the 6 PBQs, I fully completed 4, but the last 2 were **partially answered**‚ÄîI ran out of time to complete everything. This strategy worked well for me because it ensured I got through all the multiple-choice questions first, rather than getting stuck on PBQs and running out of time.  

### **PBQ Topics I Encountered**  

Here are the types of PBQs I faced:  

- **Network Diagram Placement:** One question required placing specific devices in a network diagram, ensuring proper connectivity and meeting specific requirements.  
- **Routing Table Analysis:** Another PBQ focused on interpreting routing tables and making appropriate changes.  
- **Device Command Usage:** Another question required using standard networking commands like `show interfaces`, `show vlan`, and similar commands for troubleshooting and analyzing to write a report.  
- **VLAN Tagging & Network Segmentation:** One PBQ asked about VLAN tagging across different network segments, where devices like VoIP phones, printers, and servers needed to be correctly assigned to their respective VLANs.  

If you‚Äôre preparing, make sure you understand these concepts well‚Äîespecially VLANs and troubleshooting using command-line tools.

## What Helped Me Succeed  

- **Skipping PBQs at first was a smart move.** It allowed me to get through the easier multiple-choice questions quickly and come back to PBQs with plenty of time left.  
- **Practice tests were key.** Craig Zecker‚Äôs practice exams helped me get familiar with the question format and identify my weak areas. My experience was that the practice questions I solved were harder than the actual exam.
- **Speed-watching Professor Messer‚Äôs course helped validate my knowledge.** Since I already knew the material, this was a great last-minute review.  
- **Understanding, not just memorizing.** Some exam questions were worded in ways that tested comprehension rather than rote memorization.  

## What‚Äôs Next?  

Now that I‚Äôve passed Network+, I‚Äôm looking at **Security+** next. Eventually, I want to move deeper into cybersecurity, possibly with **CEH or OSCP**.  

If you‚Äôre studying for Network+, I hope this helps! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
